abstract = {Populations are regulated intrinsically (self-regulated) when the animals lower their rate of increase behaviorally or physiologically as a reaction to rising density. They are regulated extrinsically if the equilibrium is a mechanical consequence of interaction between the population and the organisms providing its food. We suggest that, at least for mammalian herbivores, self-regulation is unlikely to evolve unless the population's intrinsic rate of increase exceeds about 0.45 on a yearly basis. That value corresponds to a body weight of about 30 kg, the intrinsic rate being related inversely to body weight by rm=1.5 W-0.36 with W in kg. The two dynamic strategies, self-regulation and extrinsic regulation, should enforce a bimodality of the frequency distribution of observed intrinsic rates of increase. This in turn might be reflected in a bimodality of body sizes, the smaller herbivores constituting the lower mode generally showing intrinsic regulation and the larger herbivores of the upper mode generally being regulated by extrinsic mechanisms. There is some empirical support for these predictions but it is by no means clearcut. Mechanisms of self-regulation can evolve either by individual or group selection. Individual selection may act in two ways. By inhibiting their neighbours with some form of interference, individuals may increase their relative fitness without increasing their reproductive rate. Alternatively, individual selection may raise the absolute fitness of individuals and thereby raise the populations's intrinsic rate of increase. The population is destabilized if that process continues beyond a certain threshold and the population is then at significant risk of extinction at the troughs of the consequent oscillations. Selection between such populations will favour those carrying the beginnings of a self-regulating mechanism, and with that mechanism strengthened and fixed by continuing group selection, individual selection is again freed of the dynamic restraints on raising further the intrinsic rate of increase. {\textcopyright} 1983 Springer-Verlag.},

El ejemplo de la vaquita muestra como estimar el poder para detectar tendencias negativas en abundancia. El poder para detectar una disminuci{\'{o}}n en la abundancia decrece a medida que las poblaciones se hacen mas peque{\~{n}}as, y en el caso de la vaquita, es inaceptablemente bajo para el rango de tama{\~{n}}os poblacionales estimados. Por consiguiente, la detecci{\'{o}}n de una declinaci{\'{o}}n en el tama{\~{n}}o poblacional no debe ser un criterio necesario para decretar medidas de conservaci{\'{o}}n en especies raras.

@article{Maxwell2005,
abstract = {1. Abundance trends provide key guidance when setting conservation priorities, whether indicating population decline, stability or recovery. Knowledge of the power of surveys to detect trends is essential, as the consequences of not detecting a real trend can be profound. 2. Unfortunately, some surveys have been established with no assessment of power, and others are used to study species that were not their original focus. The latter is common in the marine environment, where rare fish are monitored using catch data from surveys that target more abundant commercially fished species. 3. We calculated the power of a large-scale annual monitoring survey (the English North Sea bottom trawl survey) to detect decline and recovery of species that are vulnerable to fishing. As fisheries exploitation invariably precedes scientific investigation, the survey began after many vulnerable species had already been depleted. 4. The power of the survey to detect declines in the abundance of vulnerable species on time scales of < 10 years was low and the survey often failed to detect declines that would lead to listings under the IUCN A1 Red List criteria. Thus conservation prioritization based solely on survey data may fail to identify species at risk of regional extinction. 5. If conservation measures were effective, and vulnerable populations recovered at the maximum potential rate, 5-10 years of monitoring would often be required to detect recovery. 6. Power to detect trends in abundance was increased by developing a composite indicator that reflected trends in abundance of several vulnerable species. This indicator provided an overview of their conservation status. 7. Synthesis and applications. Consistent with the precautionary principle, conservation prioritization and management action should not depend on the statistical significance of recent abundance trends when low power is a consequence of historical depletion. If the conservation prioritization and management of rare and/or vulnerable species have to be predicated on evidence of significant declines, then higher type 1 error rates (falsely detecting a decline) should be acceptable. This is because the costs of type 1 errors are lower than those of type 2 (failure to detect a real decline). {\textcopyright} 2005 British Ecological Society.},

Bayesian Population Analysis Using WinBUGS goes right to the heart of the matter by providing ecologists with a comprehensive, yet concise, guide to applying WinBUGS to the types of models that they use most often: linear (LM), generalized linear (GLM), linear mixed (LMM) and generalized linear mixed models (GLMM). Comprehensive and richly-commented examples illustrate a wide range of models that are most relevant to the research of a modern population ecologist. All WinBUGS/OpenBUGS analyses are completely integrated in software R.

@article{Fairweather1991,
abstract = {This paper discusses, from a philosophical perspective, the reasons for considering the power of any statistical test used in environmental biomonitoring. Power is inversely related to the probability of making a Type II error (i.e. low power indicates a high probability of Type II error). In the context of environmental monitoring, a Type II error is made when it is concluded that no environmental impact has occurred even though one has. Type II errors have been ignored relative to Type I errors (the mistake of concluding that there is an impact when one has not occurred), the rates of which are stipulated by the a values of the test. In contrast, power depends on the value of a, the sample size used in the test, the effect size to be detected, and the variability inherent in the data. Although power ideas have been known for years, only recently have these issues attracted the attention of ecologists and have methods been available for calculating power easily. Understanding statistical power gives three ways to improve environmental monitoring and to inform decisions about actions arising from monitoring. First, it allows the most sensitive tests to be chosen from among those applicable to the data. Second, preliminary power analysis can be used to indicate the sample sizes necessary to detect an environmental change. Third, power analysis should be used after any nonsignificant result is obtained in order to judge whether that result can be interpreted with confidence or the test was too weak to examine the null hypothesis properly. Power procedures are concerned with the statistical significance of tests of the null hypothesis, and they lend little insight, on their own, into the workings of nature. Power analyses are, however, essential to designing sensitive tests and correctly interpreting their results. The biological or environmental significance of any result, including whether the impact is beneficial or harmful, is a separate issue. The most compelling reason for considering power is that Type II errors can be more costly than Type I errors for environmental management. This is because the commitment of time, energy and people to fighting a false alarm (a Type I error) may continue only in the short term until the mistake is discovered. In contrast, the cost of not doing something when in fact it should be done (a Type II error) will have both short- and long-term costs (e.g. ensuing environmental degradation and the eventual cost of its rectification). Low power can be disastrous for environmental monitoring programmes. {\textcopyright} 1991, CSIRO. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Conservation monitoring in Australia has assumed increasing importance in recent years, as societal pressure to actively manage environmental problems has risen. More resources than ever before are being channelled to the task of documenting environmental change. Yet the field remains crippled by a pervasive lack of rigour in analysing, reporting and responding to the results of data collected. Millions of dollars are currently being wasted on monitoring programmes that have no realistic chance of detecting changes in the variables of interest. This is partly because detecting change in ecological systems is a genuinely difficult technical and logistical challenge. However, the failure to plan, fund and execute sophisticated analyses of monitoring data and then to use the results to improve monitoring methods, can also be attributed to the failure of professional ecologists, conservation practitioners and bureaucrats to work effectively together. In this paper, we offer constructive advice about how all parties involved can help to change this situation. We use three case studies of recent monitoring projects from our own experience to illustrate ways in which the disconnect between science and bureaucracy can be bridged and some obstacles to collecting and analysing ecologically meaningful data sets can be overcome. We urge a continuing discussion on this issue and hope to stimulate a change in the culture of conservation monitoring in Australia. {\textcopyright} 2007 Ecological Society of Australia.},

abstract = {The diverse functional roles of over 6,000 species of extant mammals that range in body size across eight orders of magnitude, from blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) to tiny Etruscan shrews (Suncus etruscus), contribute to shaping Earth's ecosystems. Large mammalian herbivores (e.g., African elephants [Loxodonta africana], American bison [Bison bison], hippopotamuses [Hippopotamus amphibius]) and carnivores (e.g., wolves [Canis lupus], pumas [Puma concolor], sea otters [Enhydra lutris]) often have significant effects on primary producers in terrestrial, aquatic, and marine systems through nutrient cycling, energy flow, and the exertion of bottom-up and top-down processes. Small mammals, like bats, are important pollinators, dispersers of fruits, and consumers of arthropods, and others, especially rodents and primates, are important predators and dispersers of seeds. Many of these mammal-mediated processes occur simultaneously in the same ecosystem, and have significant effects on community structure of primary producers that in turn alter communities of other vertebrates and invertebrates. Many mammals also are ecosystem engineers (e.g., elephants, American beavers [Castor canadensis], porcupines [Erithezon dorsatum], prairie dogs [Cynomys spp.]) that create, significantly modify, or destroy habitat, and by doing so, they alter ecosystem structure and function and increase habitat heterogeneity and biodiversity. The extensive influence mammals have on ecosystems results in important services that contribute to human well-being, such as pollination, insect pest control, and bioturbation of soils. The rapid declines in abundance of many mammal populations and the associated increase in extinction risk raise conservation concerns for mammals. To maintain mammalian diversity and the critical ecosystem processes they provide, scientists need to mobilize concern for their status and strive for more effective and comprehensive conservation action. We provide insights and synthesis on the ecological role of mammals and highlight key research questions and future directions for their conservation.},

@article{Beaudrot2018,
abstract = {Identifying ongoing changes in the distributions of species is critical for understanding and conserving biological diversity. Distributional shifts have been demonstrated in many ecosystems and taxa, yet the extent and nature of these changes remain largely undocumented for tropical forest mammals. Shifts over short time periods can be particularly alarming in areas of the world where mammals are already under threat as a result of human activities. This is the case for Madagascar, an island where deforestation, hunting, invasive species, and other human threats have resulted in the extinction of several endemic species. Here, we ask, are the distributions of Malagasy mammals changing? We test this by modeling local colonization and extinction dynamics, which are the biological processes that produce distributional shifts. We use camera trap data from the TEAM Network for four species along a 570 m elevational gradient in Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar. The endemic Eastern red forest rat (Nesomys rufus) declined in overall occupancy while the non-native bushpig (Potamochoerus larvatus) increased in occupancy overall. The two endemic carnivore species shifted their elevational use: the Malagasy ring-tailed mongoose (Galidia elegans) retracted from higher elevations and the Malagasy civet (Fossa fossana) moved to higher elevations, likely in response to anthropogenic pressures. These results show that shifts are occurring and we can detect them with just six years of data. These results appear near unique in documenting rapid changes in the spatial distributions of tropical forest mammals and provide important information for conservation.},

@article{Dirzo2014,
abstract = {We live amid a global wave of anthropogenically driven biodiversity loss: species and population extirpations and, critically, declines in local species abundance. Particularly, human impacts on animal biodiversity are an under-recognized form of global environmental change. Among terrestrial vertebrates, 322 species have become extinct since 1500, and populations of the remaining species show 25% average decline in abundance. Invertebrate patterns are equally dire: 67% of monitored populations show 45% mean abundance decline. Such animal declines will cascade onto ecosystem functioning and human well-being. Much remains unknown about this "Anthropocene defaunation" ; these knowledge gaps hinder our capacity to predict and limit defaunation impacts. Clearly, however, defaunation is both a pervasive component of the planet 's sixth mass extinction and also a major driver of global ecological change.},

@incollection{OBrien2013,
abstract = {Summary: This chapter talks about a biodiversity indicator for top trophic levels, the Wildlife Picture Index (WPI). The WPI targets communities of terrestrial forest and savanna birds and mammals that occupy top trophic levels in their ecosystems. To develop a WPI, the chapter begins with a camera trap survey designed to be (i) spatially representative of the area of interest, (ii) of sufficient sampling intensity to detect a representative sample of the species in the target community, and (iii) of sufficient duration to develop unbiased occupancy estimates for the sampled species. Then, it presents a preliminary bootstrapping analysis of the WPI to examine the precision and robustness of the index. The WPI is a cost-effective alternative to line transect surveys, and probably other labour-intensive surveys, producing more data and more representative data for less cost. Finally, the chapter talks about strengths and weaknesses of the WPI. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},
