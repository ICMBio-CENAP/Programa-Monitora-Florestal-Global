abstract = {Identifying ongoing changes in the distributions of species is critical for understanding and conserving biological diversity. Distributional shifts have been demonstrated in many ecosystems and taxa, yet the extent and nature of these changes remain largely undocumented for tropical forest mammals. Shifts over short time periods can be particularly alarming in areas of the world where mammals are already under threat as a result of human activities. This is the case for Madagascar, an island where deforestation, hunting, invasive species, and other human threats have resulted in the extinction of several endemic species. Here, we ask, are the distributions of Malagasy mammals changing? We test this by modeling local colonization and extinction dynamics, which are the biological processes that produce distributional shifts. We use camera trap data from the TEAM Network for four species along a 570 m elevational gradient in Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar. The endemic Eastern red forest rat (Nesomys rufus) declined in overall occupancy while the non-native bushpig (Potamochoerus larvatus) increased in occupancy overall. The two endemic carnivore species shifted their elevational use: the Malagasy ring-tailed mongoose (Galidia elegans) retracted from higher elevations and the Malagasy civet (Fossa fossana) moved to higher elevations, likely in response to anthropogenic pressures. These results show that shifts are occurring and we can detect them with just six years of data. These results appear near unique in documenting rapid changes in the spatial distributions of tropical forest mammals and provide important information for conservation.},

abstract = {Summary: This chapter talks about a biodiversity indicator for top trophic levels, the Wildlife Picture Index (WPI). The WPI targets communities of terrestrial forest and savanna birds and mammals that occupy top trophic levels in their ecosystems. To develop a WPI, the chapter begins with a camera trap survey designed to be (i) spatially representative of the area of interest, (ii) of sufficient sampling intensity to detect a representative sample of the species in the target community, and (iii) of sufficient duration to develop unbiased occupancy estimates for the sampled species. Then, it presents a preliminary bootstrapping analysis of the WPI to examine the precision and robustness of the index. The WPI is a cost-effective alternative to line transect surveys, and probably other labour-intensive surveys, producing more data and more representative data for less cost. Finally, the chapter talks about strengths and weaknesses of the WPI. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

The free software program WinBUGS and its open-source sister OpenBugs is currently the only flexible and general-purpose program available with which the average ecologist can conduct standard and non-standard Bayesian statistics. Bayesian Population Analysis Using WinBUGS goes right to the heart of the matter by providing ecologists with a comprehensive, yet concise, guide to applying WinBUGS to the types of models that they use most often: linear (LM), generalized linear (GLM), linear mixed (LMM) and generalized linear mixed models (GLMM). Comprehensive and richly-commented examples illustrate a wide range of models that are most relevant to the research of a modern population ecologist. All WinBUGS/OpenBUGS analyses are completely integrated in software R. Includes complete documentation of all R and WinBUGS code required to conduct analyses and shows all the necessary steps from having the data in a text file out of Excel to interpreting and processing the output from WinBUGS in R. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Ecological conservation monitoring programmes abound at various organisational and spatial levels from species to ecosystem. Many of them suffer, however, from the lack of details of goal and hypothesis formulation, survey design, data quality and statistical power at the start. As a result, most programmes are likely to fail to reach the necessary standard of being capable of rejecting a false null hypothesis with reasonable power. Results from inadequate monitoring are misleading for their information quality and are dangerous because they create the illusion that something useful has been done. We propose that conservation agencies and those funding monitoring work should require the demonstration of adequate power at the outset of any new monitoring scheme. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Fairweather1991,
abstract = {This paper discusses, from a philosophical perspective, the reasons for considering the power of any statistical test used in environmental biomonitoring. Power is inversely related to the probability of making a Type II error (i.e. low power indicates a high probability of Type II error). In the context of environmental monitoring, a Type II error is made when it is concluded that no environmental impact has occurred even though one has. Type II errors have been ignored relative to Type I errors (the mistake of concluding that there is an impact when one has not occurred), the rates of which are stipulated by the a values of the test. In contrast, power depends on the value of a, the sample size used in the test, the effect size to be detected, and the variability inherent in the data. Although power ideas have been known for years, only recently have these issues attracted the attention of ecologists and have methods been available for calculating power easily. Understanding statistical power gives three ways to improve environmental monitoring and to inform decisions about actions arising from monitoring. First, it allows the most sensitive tests to be chosen from among those applicable to the data. Second, preliminary power analysis can be used to indicate the sample sizes necessary to detect an environmental change. Third, power analysis should be used after any nonsignificant result is obtained in order to judge whether that result can be interpreted with confidence or the test was too weak to examine the null hypothesis properly. Power procedures are concerned with the statistical significance of tests of the null hypothesis, and they lend little insight, on their own, into the workings of nature. Power analyses are, however, essential to designing sensitive tests and correctly interpreting their results. The biological or environmental significance of any result, including whether the impact is beneficial or harmful, is a separate issue. The most compelling reason for considering power is that Type II errors can be more costly than Type I errors for environmental management. This is because the commitment of time, energy and people to fighting a false alarm (a Type I error) may continue only in the short term until the mistake is discovered. In contrast, the cost of not doing something when in fact it should be done (a Type II error) will have both short- and long-term costs (e.g. ensuing environmental degradation and the eventual cost of its rectification). Low power can be disastrous for environmental monitoring programmes. {\textcopyright} 1991, CSIRO. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Conservation monitoring in Australia has assumed increasing importance in recent years, as societal pressure to actively manage environmental problems has risen. More resources than ever before are being channelled to the task of documenting environmental change. Yet the field remains crippled by a pervasive lack of rigour in analysing, reporting and responding to the results of data collected. Millions of dollars are currently being wasted on monitoring programmes that have no realistic chance of detecting changes in the variables of interest. This is partly because detecting change in ecological systems is a genuinely difficult technical and logistical challenge. However, the failure to plan, fund and execute sophisticated analyses of monitoring data and then to use the results to improve monitoring methods, can also be attributed to the failure of professional ecologists, conservation practitioners and bureaucrats to work effectively together. In this paper, we offer constructive advice about how all parties involved can help to change this situation. We use three case studies of recent monitoring projects from our own experience to illustrate ways in which the disconnect between science and bureaucracy can be bridged and some obstacles to collecting and analysing ecologically meaningful data sets can be overcome. We urge a continuing discussion on this issue and hope to stimulate a change in the culture of conservation monitoring in Australia. {\textcopyright} 2007 Ecological Society of Australia.},

El ejemplo de la vaquita muestra como estimar el poder para detectar tendencias negativas en abundancia. El poder para detectar una disminuci{\'{o}}n en la abundancia decrece a medida que las poblaciones se hacen mas peque{\~{n}}as, y en el caso de la vaquita, es inaceptablemente bajo para el rango de tama{\~{n}}os poblacionales estimados.

abstract = {1. Abundance trends provide key guidance when setting conservation priorities, whether indicating population decline, stability or recovery. Knowledge of the power of surveys to detect trends is essential, as the consequences of not detecting a real trend can be profound. 2. Unfortunately, some surveys have been established with no assessment of power, and others are used to study species that were not their original focus. The latter is common in the marine environment, where rare fish are monitored using catch data from surveys that target more abundant commercially fished species. 3. We calculated the power of a large-scale annual monitoring survey (the English North Sea bottom trawl survey) to detect decline and recovery of species that are vulnerable to fishing. As fisheries exploitation invariably precedes scientific investigation, the survey began after many vulnerable species had already been depleted. 4. The power of the survey to detect declines in the abundance of vulnerable species on time scales of < 10 years was low and the survey often failed to detect declines that would lead to listings under the IUCN A1 Red List criteria. Thus conservation prioritization based solely on survey data may fail to identify species at risk of regional extinction. 5. If conservation measures were effective, and vulnerable populations recovered at the maximum potential rate, 5-10 years of monitoring would often be required to detect recovery. 6. Power to detect trends in abundance was increased by developing a composite indicator that reflected trends in abundance of several vulnerable species. This indicator provided an overview of their conservation status. 7. Synthesis and applications. Consistent with the precautionary principle, conservation prioritization and management action should not depend on the statistical significance of recent abundance trends when low power is a consequence of historical depletion. If the conservation prioritization and management of rare and/or vulnerable species have to be predicated on evidence of significant declines, then higher type 1 error rates (falsely detecting a decline) should be acceptable. This is because the costs of type 1 errors are lower than those of type 2 (failure to detect a real decline). {\textcopyright} 2005 British Ecological Society.},
