abstract = {JAGS is Just Another Gibbs Sampler. It is a program for the analysis of Bayesian models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) which is not wholly unlike OpenBUGS (http: //www.openbugs.info). JAGS was written with three aims in mind: to have an engine for the BUGS language that runs on Unix; to be extensible, allowing users to write their own functions, distributions, and samplers; and to be a platform for experimentation with ideas in Bayesian modelling. JAGS is designed to work closely with the R language and environment for statistical computation and graphics (http://www.r-project.org). You will find it useful to install the coda package for R to analyze the output. You can also use the rjags package to work directly with JAGS from within R (but note that the rjags package is not described in this manual). JAGS is licensed under the GNU General Public License version 2. You may freely modify and redistribute it under certain conditions (see the file COPYING for details).},

abstract = {Bayesian statistics has exploded into biology and its sub-disciplines, such as ecology, over the past decade. The free software program WinBUGS and its open-source sister OpenBugs is currently the only flexible and general-purpose program available with which the average ecologist can conduct standard and non-standard Bayesian statistics. Bayesian Population Analysis Using WinBUGS goes right to the heart of the matter by providing ecologists with a comprehensive, yet concise, guide to applying WinBUGS to the types of models that they use most often: linear (LM), generalized linear (GLM), linear mixed (LMM) and generalized linear mixed models (GLMM). Comprehensive and richly-commented examples illustrate a wide range of models that are most relevant to the research of a modern population ecologist. All WinBUGS/OpenBUGS analyses are completely integrated in software R. Includes complete documentation of all R and WinBUGS code required to conduct analyses and shows all the necessary steps from having the data in a text file out of Excel to interpreting and processing the output from WinBUGS in R. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.
